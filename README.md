# Kotlin for Java Developers
### by JetBrains

This course aims to share with you the power and the beauty of **Kotlin**. We'll have a basic overview of the language, as well as a discussion of many corner cases, especially concerning **Java** interoperability. The course is based on your Java experience; it shows the similarities between the two languages and focuses on what's going to be different. 
Note that this course won't cover the programming fundamentals. We'll discuss: ***basic syntax***, ***nullability***, ***functional programming*** with **Kotlin**, ***object-oriented programming*** with **Kotlin**, the power of the **Kotlin** standard library, and **Java** interoperability.
